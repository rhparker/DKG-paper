\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-authors, Alejandro Aceves and Panos Kevrekidis, I would like to submit the article ``Stationary multi-kinks in the discrete sine-Gordon equation'' for consideration of publication in Nonlinearity. In this article, we prove the existence and spectral stability of stationary multi-kink solutions to the discrete Klein-Gordon equation, for which the we use the discrete sine-Gordon equation as a prototypical example. We present both analytical results and numerical results which are in good agreement with the theory.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
